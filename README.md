# Titian-Chondritic-Outgassing
Outgassed species from the Murchison meteorite that could potentially be linked to Titian's secondary atmosphere.


We conducted a steady heating scheme and measured species that were particular to Titan's atmosphere.
We did background measurements first to make sure we could subtract that from our heating data.
This is so we could get rid of any contamination.
We then subtracted for ion fragmentation and atmospheric adsorption so that my plots could be as accurate as possible.
Once subtraction was completed, we noticed that some atmospheirc corrections may have been to harsh. 
(We will need to assess which corrections are necessary and which are a overcorrection)
